# IMGD-05

I am making a loop in the setup() function to create 100 agents. Each agent is an object with its own position, noise offsets for movement, and size. 
And also looks like tadpole movement. 


What I want to do is the sketch checks the distance between the mouse and each agent. If the mouse is within 50 pixels, the agent calculates the angle away from the mouse and moves in that direction, producing a repelling effect
